    "Conclusions\n",
    "The code successfully reads a WAV audio file and calculates its standard deviation to determine its amplitude variation.\n",
    "Depending on the level of amplitude variation (low, medium, high), the audio data is normalized using a specific scaling factor (0.5, 0.7, 1.0 respectively).\n",
    "This approach allows for a more nuanced normalization process, taking into account the inherent properties of the audio file.\n",
    "By following this process, you're setting the stage for further audio processing, like LUFS limiting or vocal extraction, to operate more effectively on a normalized and classified audio dataset.\n",
